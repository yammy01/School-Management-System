# School-Management-System
This is a School System with teachers and students who have accounts. The teachers can put in grades and the students can look at them. This is a work in progress and is far from done.

So here's a few things you can do.

STUDENTS:
1) Create an account as a student with a username, password, age, first and last names, and then attach yourself to a teacher.
2) If you have a teacher you get grades which you can look at and check information on the assignment itself.

TEACHERS:
1) Create an account as a teacher with a username, password, age, first and last names.
2) You have a gradebook with grades (which is empty if you have no students). You get students when students look for you on their side.
3) You can create an assignment and assign a grade to students in your class.
